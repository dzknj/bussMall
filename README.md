Mon. January 18th: This is the first day of the new project in which I'll be building a market analysis app to figure out which products are most likely to sell in the buss mall catalog.  I will be displaying three products at a time on a user facing page and will be asking for the user to vote on the most appealing product.  Using JavaScript I will calculate and store these results as well as display more products to the user.  After running through 15 different products the user will be able to see the results of the analysis.  In my userstories.md file I will have all of the user stories I have written in order to keep track of my project goals.
