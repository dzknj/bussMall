Marketing/Reasearch Team:
- As a marketing team I want to be able to see the results of the product voting process displayed in a chart or table for quick and organized reference.
- As a marketing team I want the user to see all of the available products at least one time so that an option to vote on every product is presented.
- As a marketing team I want a public facing page to display at least three products in the form of images.
- As a marketing team I would like all of the shown images to be similarly presented as to not encourage voting in any particular way.
- As a marketing team I want a public facing page that accurately describes the task the user is to take part in.  To provide a small introduction to Buss Mall and fully understand the product voting process.  
- As a marketing team I want the results of the voting process to be hidden from the user until all products have been presented so voting statistics don't interfere with real time product analysis.
- As a marketing team I want the final voting results to for shadow the future products that will be sold in the Buss Mall catalog.
